MPC - Multi Persona Chatbot
===========================

How was this created ?
I have some basic understanding of python, java + spare time during weekends.
Inspired by SillyTavern (but i wanted something very very simple).
Created with the help of ChatGPT, Deepseek, Claude -all non paid -it took months.

My dev system:
Manjaro + AMD 2700 + RTX 3060 + 32 GB RAM + Python 3.13.5 + LM Studio (with many LLMs) + VSCodium

What does this do ?
Its kind of playing improv scenarios, where someone gives a context like "you're all stuck in an elevator" 
or "you're pirates who just found treasure but can't agree how to split it," and players improvise their 
roles within that situation.

The app allows user to define personas, set a context and trigger some chat between them.
User can also act as a persona and steer the conversation manually. It uses apis provided 
by lm studio nd llms from huggingface.

Is this fully functional/secure ?
No idea. It might work for some case. The personas tend to loose their purpose after some time.
Security was not considered for development.
Warning: The "content" from model, context OR the user's manual intervention can steer personas to go NSFW.

Does it require internet ?.
- To download requirements, lm studio requirements, llms -Yes
- To chat -No; Unless ur system is connected to internet and lm studio leaks it (which i am not aware).

Is there any similar app ?
SillyTavern etc. many web apps.
